				<h2>HANDMADE PASSION</h2>
				<p>Over time, fine jewelry can become a treasured family heirloom if it is cared for properly. Dust, pollution and daily wear all conspire to cloud the brilliance of gemstones. The surface of gold, platinum and silver jewelry can become dulled. Timeworn prongs and clasps can result in the loss of a stone or an entire piece of jewelry. </p>

				<p>Professional cleanings are recommended as often as once a year. We encourage you to bring your Tiffany & Co. jewelry back to us for professional servicing. Our staff is knowledgeable and experienced in all aspects of jewelry care, including cleaning gemstones, restringing pearls and repairing clasps and earring backs.</p>
